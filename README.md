## Games

### Sudoku

Implementation of the classic Sudoku game using functional programming concepts. The game provides various difficulty levels and interactive gameplay.

### Chess

A text-based implementation of the Chess game, allowing two players to play against each other. The game enforces the standard rules of Chess.

### Checkers

A functional implementation of the Checkers (Draughts) game. Players can make moves according to the official Checkers rules.

### Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple console-based implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game, offering two-player gameplay.

### 8 Queens

A game of placing eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other.

### Connect 4

A functional implementation of the Connect 4 game, where players take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a vertically suspended grid.

## Solvers

### Sudoku Solver

A Prolog-based solver for Sudoku puzzles. Given a partially filled Sudoku grid, the solver can find a solution or verify if the provided solution is correct.

### 8 Queens Solver

A Prolog solver for the 8 Queens puzzle. Given a chessboard, the solver can find solutions where eight queens can be placed without threatening each other.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/AbdelrahmanWael2/Game-Engine-Scala.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific game or solver directory.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the report for each game and solvers.
